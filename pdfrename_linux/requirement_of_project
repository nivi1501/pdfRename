Original requirement: the pdfrename software should run flawlessly on Windows and Linux
3. On Windows:
     i. When you install the software using the standard installer package, it should first check
        if a previous version exists. If it does, it should overwrite.
     ii. The PDF Rename option should be added to the right click menu.
     iii. It should be possible to sequentially rename a bunch of files by selecting multiple pdf files (right click and drag).
4. On Linux
    i. The pdfrename command should be added to the command line path.
    ii. Installation should not require superuser permissions. It should check to see if $HOME/bin is in the path.
    iii. Should be possible to rename multiple pdf files at once: pdfrename *.pdf (for example)
5. On both:
   i. It should first check if the network is connected.
   ii. If not, it should indicate the same to the user, and ask if the user uses a proxy server.
   iii. If the user says yes to a proxy server, then it should check if it has stored details. If it does, then it should ask
        the user to confirm the details and ask if the details need to be changed. If the user says yes, then there should be
       an option to do so. The new details will be saved (there should be no need to enter this information every time).
   iv. There should be an option to "Retry" or "Cancel" at every point in this stage.
6. There should be detailed error messages for every exceptional condition. At no point should the program crash.
7. There should be no repetition of code. The pdfrename.sh script is very cluttered. Needs to be cleaned up. Other than
    a right mouse button click on Windows and typing pdfrename on Linux, the user should not need to do anything else.
